                            <p>Darakhshan, a Fashion Management Grad from NIFT, Delhi, buys a lot of fancy shoes and does it almost every day. She also knows how to create magic with the team and brings  out   their absolute best! We are intrigued by her wicked communication skills yet love it when she exclaims "Shucks". Oh Shucks! We forgot to mention, her love for shoes is surpassed only by her         passion for Ministry.</p>

Everything he does is so fast that we can’t tell when he makes things  happen. We really don’t know when he comes and goes, the only thing we know for sure is that his code works like magic, and that's what really counts for all our partners at Ministry!</p>
